    faqs:
      - question: What services do medical clinics typically offer?
        answer: >-
          Medical clinics offer a wide range of services, including primary
          care, preventive care, diagnostics, and treatment for acute and
          chronic illnesses. Services may also include immunizations, physical
          exams, lab tests, minor surgeries, and specialized care such as
          pediatrics, dermatology, and gynecology. Some clinics also offer
          mental health services and telemedicine consultations.
      - question: What’s the difference between a medical clinic and a hospital?
        answer: >-
          The main difference is the scope of services and care intensity.
          Medical clinics focus on outpatient care, providing general health
          services, preventive care, and treatments for non-emergency
          conditions. Hospitals, on the other hand, handle more complex and
          urgent medical cases, including surgeries, emergency care, and
          inpatient services where patients may need to stay overnight for
          observation or recovery.
      - question: Do I need an appointment to visit a medical clinic?
        answer: >-
          It depends on the clinic. Some clinics operate on an appointment-only
          basis, while others accept walk-ins for urgent care. Many clinics now
          offer online booking for appointments or same-day scheduling to
          accommodate patients with immediate needs. Telemedicine services are
          also becoming increasingly available for virtual consultations without
          the need for in-person visits.
      - question: How are medical clinics staffed?
        answer: >-
          Medical clinics are typically staffed by a variety of healthcare
          professionals, including doctors (general practitioners or
          specialists), nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses,
          medical assistants, and administrative staff. Depending on the
          clinic’s specialty, there may also be lab technicians, pharmacists, or
          counselors to provide specific services. The team works together to
          provide comprehensive care to patients.
      - question: How do medical clinics handle payment and insurance?
        answer: >-
          Most medical clinics accept a range of payment options, including
          private health insurance, government programs like Medicare and
          Medicaid, and out-of-pocket payments. Clinics usually verify insurance
          coverage before treatment and may provide payment plans for patients
          without insurance. Patients are often responsible for copays,
          deductibles, or the full cost of services if not covered by insurance.
      - question: What should I bring to my first visit at a medical clinic?
        answer: >-
          For your first visit, it's important to bring a valid ID, your health
          insurance card, and a list of current medications, including dosages.
          You should also bring any relevant medical records, such as past test
          results or diagnoses, and details about your family medical history.
          If you’ve seen other doctors for the same issue, bring any referral
          letters or previous treatment notes. Lastly, prepare a list of any
          symptoms or questions you have for the doctor to make the visit as
          productive as possible.
